```bash
$ kubectl explain pod ºs.spec.affinity --output=plaintext-openapiv2
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: affinity <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     If specified, the pods scheduling constraints

     Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules.

FIELDS:
|...|

   podAntiAffinity	<Object>
     Describes pod anti-affinity scheduling rules (e.g. avoid putting this pod
     in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

$ kubectl explain pods.spec.affinity.podAntiAffinity --output=plaintext-openapiv2
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: podAntiAffinity <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Describes pod anti-affinity scheduling rules (e.g. avoid putting this pod
     in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

     Pod anti affinity is a group of inter pod anti affinity scheduling rules.

FIELDS:
   preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution	<[]Object>
     The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the
     anti-affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node
     that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most
     preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node
     that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request,
     requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by
     iterating through the elements of this field and subtracting "weight" from
     the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding
     podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.

   requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution	<[]Object>
     If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at
     scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the
     anti-affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some
     point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may
     or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are
     multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm
     are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.
